# Core Economics Journals

These links are provided for convenient browsing of current issues of core economics journals.  They are maintained by hand, so if they break, please let me know!  I have chosen the link that best represents the current authorized subscription to the journal.  I have not included alternative links to content from databases like Business Source Premier, or backfiles from JSTOR and other locations.

For complete listings of economics journals, and a wider selection of links to backfiles, check [QuickSearch](quicksearch.libraries.rutgers.edu) and the [Electronic Journals](quicksearch.libraries.rutgers.edu/journals). Those are also the sources to turn to if you encounter a broken link on this page.

Note that the links provided are for on-campus access at Rutgers.  To access from off campus, use [the library catalog](quicksearch.libraries.rutgers.edu)to look up the appropriate link, or use the [Rutgers VPN](soc.rutgers.edu/vpn/).
